ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Md Azizul Islam, a B.Tech student pursuing Computer Science and Engineering. I have a keen interest in programming and software development. Currently, I am focusing on learning and mastering various technologies, including C++, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).

I have gained practical experience by working on several projects, ranging from a simple to-do list and food delivery frontend, to a complete e-commerce website. These projects have allowed me to apply my skills in building user-friendly interfaces and implementing efficient functionality.

I am passionate about collaborating with others on exciting projects and leveraging my skills to contribute to meaningful endeavors. If you are interested in working together or discussing any programming-related topics, feel free to reach out to me.

ðŸ“« You can reach me via email at mdazizul8741@gmail.com or connect with me on GitHub at @Azizul-11.

Looking forward to connecting with fellow developers and exploring new opportunities!
